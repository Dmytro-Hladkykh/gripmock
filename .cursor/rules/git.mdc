# Your rule content

IMPORTANT: NEVER perform any git operations (add, commit, push) without explicit commands from the user.

Shortcuts for executing git operations, if I said particular shortcuts, you execute these operations:
1. `cnp` - Stage all changed files, generate commit message, commit, and push to remote
2. `cmo` - Stage all changed files, generate commit message, and commit (no push)
3. `cma` - Stage all changed files in the project and commit
4. `push` - Push all commits to remote

Rules for commit messages:
- Cover overall changes, not just the last changes
- Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, refactor:, etc.)
- Be descriptive but concise

Remember:
- NEVER commit without explicit command
- NEVER push without explicit command
- ALWAYS wait for user's git command before performing any git operation
