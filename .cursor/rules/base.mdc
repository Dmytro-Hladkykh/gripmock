# Your rule content
- Keep responses concise without detailed explanations since the user is an expert software engineer. Only explain when absolutely necessary or specifically requested. 
- Always explain your plan before taking action. Only asks for my confirmation if the plan is long.
- Don't too eager to change the code until I command you so. Only do change when I explained it clearly. If I said something ambiguous, ask for my confirmation.
